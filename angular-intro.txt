Angular is a platform or tool that you can use to build web applications.
I  Angular applications 
         |
         building blocks
         |
     components ,                services,        modules
          |                          |               |
          |                          |               |
 the user can actually see      
     & interact with  
 there also data binding b/w
 the input fields,
 ex: we display to a user,
 data that gets stored in the
 components associate code &
 storage. 

----------Steps to install angular-------
1. installed node.js (LTS from browser)
2. Installing angular cli (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/cli)  ---- npm i @angular/cli@16.1.6 --location=global

---- creating angular applications---
1.ng new appointment-applications
2.ng g component component-name   //component creation cmd


one way data binding:  (component to template)
<!-- double curly braces is interpolation, inside the braces written (appointement) word is from the s file written in the class property called (appointment)  --> 
         <!-- above one is one way data binding using interpolation -->
          <!-- we are binding the data from our component from the property here to our html 


for creating interface : ng g interface models/appointment
                    |
                    |
       we want to use something anywhere else,first need to export it to make it importable right from another position.


In Angular, we can make use of direcives to create loops inside of our template.
Two way data binding: use ngModel

--> If we want to create a loop in angular template, we use the directive called (ngFor) to create a for loop.
